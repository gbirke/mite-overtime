# Next steps:
- Add German holidays.
- Add daily overtime decorator
- Add daily display to HTML renderer. Render days as a 3-column table (Day, hours, total) below each week. Use different colors for holidays and days from other months.
- Store configuration data in localStorage, "logout" cleans it. Show/hide settings panel as needed.
- Refactor CalendarGenerator to generate domain objects, refactor EntriesToDaysConverter to EntriesToDaysDecorator, simplify EntriesStore and HTML renderer to use the new singular data structure.
- Check earliest date to avoid navigating to empty months
- Add history for pagination (back button in browser).
- Calculate yearly overtime (with offset from previous year).
- Add date range view (4 weeks or date entry), all days in range are counted. For date ranges > 1 year, the weeks calculated in `OvertimeFactory` need to be stored with different keys (year-weekNumber instead of weekNumber)
- Track/mark special entries ( sick days, vacation) in the time data and display it
- Graphical "hedgehog" display of overtime ( arcs with the same angle for days/weeks in a month and different radii, depending on overtime/undertime)
- Prettier design
- Refactor to use Redux instead of Reflux
- Use TypeScript and babel/webpack instead of browserify
- Load & cache entries in the background
