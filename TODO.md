# Next steps in the weekly-display branch:

- Add ability to exclude certain worktime entries (sick days, holidays, overtime compensation). Don't add overtime compensation to the total. Track/mark special entries in the time data for later display
- Add daily display to HTML renderer. Render days as a 3-column table (Day, hours, total) below each week
- Don't calculate/show totals/missing time for dates after current day
- Display week dates a bit smaller
